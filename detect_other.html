           <h1>A STORY OF DETECTING OTHER WORLDS: TRANSITING EXOPLANET</h1>
            <b>We can detect planets by analyzing starlight.</b><br>
            
            Scientists have detected thousands of exoplanets: planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. <br>
            We have seen only a few exoplanets directly, but we can detect them by measuring the effects they have on the stars they orbit.<br>
            
            One effect a planet can have is to block some of the star’s light as it passes between the star and the telescope.<br>
             This is known as a transit. As an exoplanet transits its star, the star appears to dim very slightly. Although the planet itself is too far away to see, <br>
             we can detect slight changes in the brightness of the star. If we observe a pattern—if the same change in brightness happens a few times at regular intervals—we can infer that a planet is orbiting the star.<br>
              Analyzing the brightness pattern, or light curve, of the star also helps us figure out the time it takes the planet to orbit (the length of the planet’s year), <br>
              the size of the planet, and how close it is to its star.
            
            The light curve shown here is based on Kepler space telescope observations of the star HAT-P-7 and its exoplanet HAT-P-7 b,<br>
             which was discovered in 2008. Kepler has been used to detect more than 2,300 planets using the transit method. HAT-P-7 b’s large size relative to its star, <br>
             along with its short orbital period of just over two days, made it relatively easy to detect using the transit method. Because of its size, mass, and high surface temperature,<br> 
             HAT-P-7 b is classified as a “Hot Jupiter” exoplanet.<br><br>
            
            <b style="font-size: 30px;">QUICK FACTS: TRANSITING EXOPLANET</b><br>
            <b>Also known as:</b> Kepler-2b<br>
           <b> Type: </b>Hot Jupiter<br>
           <b> Distance from Earth:</b> about 1,100 light-years<br>
           <b> Size:</b> 1.36 times the radius of Jupiter<br>
            <b>Mass:</b> 1.8 times the mass of Jupiter<br>
           <b> Transit duration:</b> about 3 1/2 hours<br>
            <b>Orbital period:</b> 2.2 Earth-days<br>
            <b>Location in the sky:</b> Cygnus Constellation<br>
           <b> Location in the universe:</b> orbiting star HAT-P-7, inside the Milky Way Galaxy<br>
            <b>Did you know:</b> Other observations of HAT-P-7 b suggest that it has aluminum oxide vapor in its atmosphere. On Earth, aluminum oxide exists as rubies, sapphires, and other forms of the mineral corundum.<br>
