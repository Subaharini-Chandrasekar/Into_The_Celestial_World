  <h2>GALAXY</h2>
  <img src="g.jpg" width="300" height="300">
  <p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
    A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has<u> a Supermassive black hole</u> in the middle.
  Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually dubbed 
  irregular.
  
  Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around 
  13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed approximately 500 million years ago.
   </p>

<div id="section2" class="container-fluid bg-white text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h2>OUR MILKY WAY GALAXY</h2>
  <img src="MILKKK.jpg" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. 
    Earth is located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about 240 million 
    years to orbit the Milky Way just once.From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing 
    across the entire sky, which is how it got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge on.

    The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf 
    galaxies (smaller galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbor.
    
    The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of the Laniakea supercluster.</p>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-black text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
  <h2>SPIRAL GALAXY</h2>
  <img src="sg1.jpg" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae and, as such,
     form part of the Hubble sequence. Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating disk containing stars, gas and dust, and a central
      concentration of stars known as the bulge. These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars, many of which reside in 
      globular clusters.

    Spiral galaxies are named by their spiral structures that extend from the center into the galactic disc. The spiral arms are sites 
    of ongoing star formation and are brighter than the surrounding disc because of the young, hot OB stars that inhabit them.
</p>

  <div id="section4" class="container-fluid bg-white text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
    <h2>ELLIPTICAL GALAXY</h2>
    <img src="E@.jpg" width="300" height="300">
    <p>An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image. They are 
      one of the four main classes of galaxy described by Edwin Hubble in his Hubble sequence and 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae,
       along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical  galaxies are, together with lenticular galaxies  with their large-scale 
       disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks, a subset of the "early-type" galaxy population.

      Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older, low-mass stars, with a sparse interstellar medium, and they tend to be surrounded 
      by large numbers of globular clusters. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="section5" class="container-fluid bg-black text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
      <h2>IRREGULAR GALAXY</h2>
      <img src="ig.jpg" width="300" height="300">
      <p>An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. 
        Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, and they are often chaotic in 
        appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure.

        Collectively they are thought to make up about a quarter of all galaxies. Some irregular galaxies were once spiral or 
        elliptical galaxies but were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. Irregular galaxies may contain abundant 
        amounts of gas and dust.This is not necessarily true for dwarf irregulars.[4]</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section6" class="container-fluid bg-white text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
        <h2>DWARF GALAXY</h2>
        <img src="dg.jpg" width="300" height="300">
        <p>A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of about 1000 up to several billion stars, as compared to the Milky Way's
           200–400 billion stars. The Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30 billion 
           stars is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy; others consider it a full-fledged galaxy. Dwarf galaxies' formation 
           and activity are thought to be heavily influenced by interactions with larger galaxies. Astronomers identify numerous 
           types of dwarf galaxies, based on their shape and composition.</p>
        
      </div>
      
      <div id="section7" class="container-fluid bg-black text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
        <h2>GALAXY GROUPS AND CLUSTERS</h2>
        <img src="g.jpg" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Galaxy groups and clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound objects to have arisen thus far in the process of
           cosmic structure formation.[2] They form the densest part of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In models for the 
           gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the 
           largest structures, clusters of galaxies. Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now. 
           Groups and clusters may contain ten to thousands of individual galaxies. The clusters themselves are often associated with 
           larger, non-gravitationally bound, groups called superclusters.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="section8" class="container-fluid bg-white text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
          <h2>SUPERCLUSTERS</h2>
          <img src="sc.jpg" width="300" height="300">
          <p>A supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups;they are among the largest known structures
             in the universe. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy group (which contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn
              is part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is part of the Laniakea Supercluster, which is part of the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster 
              Complex.The large size and low density of superclusters means that they, unlike clusters, expand with the Hubble expansion.
               The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.</p>
