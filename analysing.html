           <h1> A STORY OF ANALYZING LIGHT: SPECTRUM OF THE STAR ALTAIRs</h1>
            <b>Patterns in colors of starlight provide important information about the star.</b><br>
            
            Almost everything we know about Altair, a bright star in the constellation Aquila, comes from studying its light.<br> 
            We know that Altair is 10 times brighter than the Sun,<br>
            rotates once on its axis every 9 hours, has an average surface temperature of about 8,000 degrees Celsius, and is slightly flattened in shape.<br>
            
            There are two main ways to study starlight: with images and with spectra. An image captured by a camera attached to a telescope shows us what the star looks like: its brightness,<br>
             color, apparent size, and shape. An image can also help us figure out where the star is located relative to other objects in the sky.<br>
            
            Most scientific telescopes also include spectrographs, tools used to spread light out into a rainbow of light known as a spectrum. <br>
            A starâ€™s spectrum shows the individual colors that combine to make up the overall color of the star.<br>
             A spectrum also reveals small variations in the brightness of these different colors.<br> 
             The brightness pattern provides additional details about the star, such as its composition, surface temperature, and how it is moving in space.<br>
            
            While some spectral features are obvious in a picture of a spectrum, others are very subtle. <br>
            It is easy to see that there are differences in brightness, but it is almost impossible to tell exactly how bright or dim each color is. <br>
            In fact, a picture of a spectrum can be deceiving because the human eye and brain perceive colors like blue as darker than colors like yellow, even when blue is brighter. <br>
            The graph form of a spectrum is important because it shows exactly how bright each individual color (wavelength) of light is relative to every other color.<br><br>
